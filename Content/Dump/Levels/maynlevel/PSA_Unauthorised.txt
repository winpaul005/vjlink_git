Hello, is anyone there? How's the situation in dogma control?
Hello, i cannot hear you!
Fine, let's hope your audio at least works better. As i can see from here dogma control room is locked, and access from alternative routes - via one of the distribution nodes is risky due to the occupation by.. Anomalies happened after the experiment. It is possible to unlock the gates from my side, and there are no anomalies around in your area, so get there, reach the comms room, try to call me there, and maybe then we could discuss our attempt to end this nightmare. My uid should be saved automatically on your pda, so there should not be any trouble, except for the monsters. Payne over and out.
